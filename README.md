# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

## Problem Statement

The ACT has been gaining popularity over the years and had surpassed the SAT in participation rate in the United States in 2012 and was winning state contracts. To address the declining market share, the College Board designed a new format for SAT which was released in March 2016. This report seeks to examine trends in the SAT and ACT participation rates and scores from 2017 to 2018 to uncover insights that could help to suggest a suitable state in which to focus the College Board's resources to improve SAT participate rate. 

## Summary of Findings and Recommendation

Participation rates for SAT and ACT are highly influenced by the state policies on college admissions. In general, states with high participation rates for either tests tend to have low participation rates for the other, which is especially true for states which adopt mandatory testing for one of the tests as seen in Illinois and Colorado which replaced mandatory ACT with SAT recently. As such, efforts to increase participation rates for SAT should be targeted to those states which do not have mandatory requirement for ACT.

The SAT scores and highest/ lowest scoring states remained largely similar between 2017 and 2018, with addition of more states adopting mandatory SAT requirement. Test scores tend to be lower in states which adopt mandatory testing for either tests, compared to voluntary states.  

Based on the analysis, efforts to increase participation rates for SAT should be targeted towards California state where ACT is currently not mandatory. SAT is also a more popular choice compared to ACT for most districts within California hence there would be better chances of success in convincing the colleges to adopt SAT as the testing standard. In addtion, there is a high student population base thus resources could be allocated more efficiently to maximise pay-offs in increasing participation rate. 

Possible suggestions the College Board could adopt to increase SAT participation rate include fully subsidising SAT fees, making preparatory resources readily available and combining with free tutoring classes which have added advantage to raise test scores.
